# Introduction

Welcome to the Neutron documents site. There are many sections to browse depending on the exact thing you're looking for. Here is a quick summary of each section:

* Smart Contract Docs -- This serves as a reference for writing smart contracts in Rust for the Neutron platform. This would be what most people are looking for \(eventually, when Neutron is closer to usable\)
* Integration Guide -- This is documents for how to integrate Neutron into a new or existing platform, so that any platform can make use of its sandboxed smart contract functionality. This section also discusses adding custom features to Neutron such as new virtual machines or Elements to expose unique functionality of the platform
* Neutron Contributor Info -- This provides practical guides for how the neutron-host project is organized, and how to contribute code to the core of Neutron
* Specification -- The master technical specification and standards established for Neutron
